    /*
    objects take in function.
    There are other ways to call properties of an object. we have the dot notation an the [] notation. []notations helps with properties that .notation can't access eg, prodect2.deliver-time. because of the maths sign, Js would try to do maths but with [] it adds it as it should be

    JSON is another JS just that it is universerly accepted and JS isn't.  
    Changing JSON to javaScipt and back
